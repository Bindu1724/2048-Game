# 2048-Game with Python


It's a single-player puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid, merging them to create the tile with the number 2048. You can move the tiles up, down, left, or right, and when two tiles with the same number touch, they combine into one. The key is strategic thinking to keep the grid from filling up.
